Ideally, you'll be able to set the configurations and then hop into the project and start coding. Most of the project set-up _should_ be handled by the configurations.

Project specific configuation options are all located in the `configs` directory. This directory contains a number of files that are used to configure the project. The following is a list of the files and their purpose:

- `SITE` - This file contains the site specific configuration options. This file is used to set the site title, description, and other site specific options.

- `AUTHORS` - This file contains the list (organized as an array of objects) of authors for the project. It's intended to offer convenience for multi-author blogs, apps, projects, etc...

- `BLOG` - This file contains the configuration options for the blog. This file is used to set the blog title, description, and other blog specific options.

- `DOCS` - This file contains the configuration options for the documentation.

🌟TIPS!!!!!

The structure of the configs directory is being used to create a demonstration of how the theme, files, and directories can be organized. It also serves as a starting to point to introduce to developers the 'patterns' I'll be coding in throughout the project.

I could have just as easily created a single `config.js` file and export a single object with all of the configuration options. This would be a more traditional approach to configuration in a JavaScript project. I chose to use multiple files to demonstrate and set the 'tone' for how I'm organizing the project.
